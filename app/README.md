## What's Carbon, anyway?

It's [IBM's design system](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) with ready-to-go component implementations
in Angular, React and Vue.

## Development and self-hosting

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the required packages and it's only needed the first time, and when you update.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
