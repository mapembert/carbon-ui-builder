# Introduction

Carbon UI Builder uses _live components_.

Live components adjust to the environment you put them in. They behave the same way
as the components from Carbon libraries do. They

* resize when screen (or window) resizes,
* change the position based on where they are,
* change the spacing based on other components around them.

This means you

1. build once,
2. test with the preview mode, and
3. adjust the properties.

This doesn't mean you have to prescribe everything. Components have built-in defaults and they will try to do the right thing. You only need to intervene to customize the appearance or the behaviour.

## Left pane

**Left pane** contains global elements.

Drag and drop elements from the left pane into the center canvas.

Create custom css classes that can be applied on any element.

## Right pane

**Right pane** contains contextual information about a currently selected element.

Click outside of any component to access fragment settings.
